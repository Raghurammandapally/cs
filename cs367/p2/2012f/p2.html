<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>The goals of this assignment are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and implement a doubly-linked chain of nodes.</li>
  <li>Gain experience working with Java references (i.e., pointers).</li>
  <li>Implement an iterator.</li>
  <li>Implement an exception.</li>
  <li>Gain experience writing classes which implement Java interfaces.</li>
  <li>Develop an application that processes input commands.</li>
  <li>Get more practice with console and file I/O.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you'll implement a <tt>LinkedList</tt> class that
uses a chain of linked nodes as its data structure. You'll then implement
an application that uses <tt>LinkedList</tt>s to represent a log of robot
"commands", which we'll call the "Robot Log". The "commands" will be
represented using Java <tt>String</tt>s as specified below.  Your application
(i.e., the main class) will prompt the user to choose an operation from a
set of options (described below) that manipulate the Robot Log.</p>

<p>It is typical for today's programmers to use ADTs that are already
implemented as part of a class library (e.g., C++ Standard Template Library)
or an API (e.g., Java's Application Program Interface).  Understanding
ADT <i>implementations</i> is still important to be able to make informed
choices as to which ADT implementation is best suited for an application
in terms of memory and time efficiencies. For example, knowing the tradeoffs
between array and linked implementations of the <tt>List</tt> ADT helps us
choose between Java's <tt>ArrayList</tt> and <tt>LinkedList</tt> classes. It
is also important to be able to implement your own data structures when
pre-built ones are not available or when standard ADTs (and their
operations) are unsuitable for the intended application.</p>

<p>We'll provide an interface for a <tt>LinkedListADT</tt>, which you'll
implement as the <tt>LinkedList</tt> class using a doubly-linked chain of
nodes. You'll also code iterator and exception classes needed to support
your <tt>LinkedList</tt> implementation.</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<a name="file"></a>
<h3>Robot Log Text File</h3>

<p>Your program will have the ability to load in a log from a text file,
and save a log to a text file. You won't be required to write any robot
"commands" yourself, and you can assume that any input file provided will
have properly formatted "commands". An input file will be formatted such
that each line is an individual robot command, followed by a blank line
at the very end of the file. There is a 
<a href="assignments/p2/files/sampleLog.txt">sample input file</a>
here for you to use when testing your code. Each line will be stored in your
Robot Log as a 
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_tab"><tt>String</tt></a>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> You are not required to do any text parsing for this assignment.
Your code will read a file line by line, but we'll assume the lines are in the
correct format for robot commands. We'll simply treat these commands as strings,
and we'll not be dividing those strings into smaller parts.</p>

<p>Information about Java I/O is  available in both a 
<a href="assignments/p1/resources/JavaIO_summary.html">summary version</a> and a
<a href="assignments/p1/resources/JavaIO_Scanner.html">detailed version</a>.
Examples of file input are linked to in those documents.</p>
      

<h3>The <tt>LinkedListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface</h3>

<p>A <tt>LinkedListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface is provided for you (see
<a href="assignments/p2/files/LinkedListADT.java"><tt>LinkedListADT.java</tt></a>).
<tt>LinkedListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> is a generic interface that your
<tt>LinkedList</tt> class will implement. The interface specifies the following
methods, which you will implement in your <tt>LinkedList</tt> class.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>You may <b><em>not</em></b> modify the <tt>LinkedListADT</tt> interface in
any way.</p>


<h3>The <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt> class</h3>

<p>The <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt> class represents one node of a chain of nodes
used by your <tt>LinkedList</tt> class. This class is also provided for you;
see <a href="assignments/p2/files/ListNode.java"><tt>ListNode.java</tt></a>.
You should <b><em>not</em></b> modify this class. It has the following methods
and constructor:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th width="40%">Constructor</th>
    <th width="60%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;()</tt></td>
    <td>Constructs an empty <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt> with no data and 
        null pointers to its previous and next nodes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;(ListNode&lt;E&gt; prev,
    E data, ListNode&lt;E&gt; next)</tt></td>

  <tr>
    <td><tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt; getPrev()</tt></td>
    <td>Returns the <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt> that comes before this <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt>. Returns null if this node does not have a previous node.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt; getNext()</tt></td>
    <td>Returns the <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt> that comes after this <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt>. Returns null if this node does not have a next node.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>void setData(E data)</tt></td>
    <td>Sets the data stored in this node to the specified item.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>void setPrev(ListNode&lt;E&gt; prev)</tt></td>
    <td>Sets the previous node to point to the given <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>void setNext(ListNode&lt;E&gt; prev)</tt></td>
    <td>Sets the next node to point to the given <tt>ListNode&lt;E&gt;</tt>.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h3>The <tt>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> class</h3>

<p>You'll code a <tt>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> class that your application
will use to store the Robot Log. This class must implement the
<tt>LinkedListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface, which requires you to implement
each method listed in the <tt>LinkedListADT&lt;E&gt;</tt> interface. You may
add other methods as necessary; however, any additional methods <i>other than a 
constructor</i> should be private.</p>


<h3>The <tt>LinkedListIterator&lt;E&gt;</tt> class</h3>

<p>You'll code a <tt>LinkedListIterator&lt;E&gt;</tt> class for your
<tt>LinkedList</tt> class.  This class must implement Java's
<tt>Iterator&lt;E&gt;</tt>, which requires you to implement each of these
methods: hasNext(), next() and remove(). Note for remove(), you only need
to throw Java's <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> as described in
lecture.</p>


<h3>The <tt>InvalidListPositionException</tt> class</h3>

<p>You'll code an exception class to be used by your <tt>LinkedList</tt>
class. It must be a checked exception. You may write any constructors and
methods you deem necessary for this class.</p>


<h3>The <tt>RobotLogMain</tt> class</h3>

<p>The application program, <tt>RobotLogMain</tt>, creates and uses an
<tt>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> to represent and process a log of robot
"commands".  Similarly to <a href="?r=programs&programNumber=1">Program 1</a>,
this will be a relatively simple application class. You'll write code for
each of the options listed below. Your code should make appropriate use of
the <tt>LinkedList</tt>, <tt>LinkedListIterator</tt>, and
<tt>InvalidListPositionException</tt> classes you have written.</p>

<p>To help you with this, we're provideing the
<a href="assignments/p2/files/RobotLogMain.java"><tt>RobotLogMain.java</tt></a>
file, which contains the outline of the <tt>RobotLogMain</tt> class. Download
this file and use it as the starting point for your <tt>RobotLogMain</tt>
implementation.</p>

<a name="main"></a>
<p>Note: Unlike <a href="?r=programs&programNumber=1">Program 1</a>, you will
not read from a file given as a command-line argument. You'll instead load
information from a file when given the 'l' command, described below.</p>

<p>The command options are:</p>   

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>

<tr>
  <th width="15%">Command format</th>
  <th width="85%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>l <i>fileName</i></tt></td>
  <td><b>L</b>oad the robot log from the given file. See the <a href="#file">
      file description</a> of the file format. You'll write code to read in
      from the file line by line until the end of the file (a blank line) is
      reached. Each of these lines should be stored as one item in your robot
      log. If the file cannot be found, display "<tt>Cannot find the specified
      file.</tt>" Once the file is loaded, print each line according to the 
      specifications under command 'p'.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>p</tt></td>
  <td><b>P</b>rint the robot log. The log should be printed line by line, with
      each line preceded by its line number. For example:
      <dir>
      1 Name:Robot1 Move:Forward Distance:10 Speed:Fast<br>
      2 Name:Robot2 Move:Right Distance:2 Speed:Slow<br>
      3 Name:Robot1 Move:Right Distance:7 Speed:Fast<br>
      4 Name:Robot2 Move:Back Distance:8 Speed:Middle<br>
      </dir>
      <p>Note that the lines are indexed starting at 1. You should not have a
      line # 0. If the robot log is empty, print "<tt>Empty</tt>".</p>
  </td>
</tr>  
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>r <i>line#</i></tt></td>
  <td>
    <b>R</b>emove the specified line number from the list. If an
    InvalidListPositionException is thrown, catch that exceptinon and print,
    "<tt>Invalid line number.</tt>" If the argument is not an int, 
print,
    "<tt>Please enter a valid integer.</tt>" Once the line has been removed,
    print "<tt>Successfully removed line <i>line#</i></tt>".
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>s <i>fileName</i></tt></td>
  <td>
    <b>S</b>ave the file to the specified fileName. This file should be saved
    in the same format as an input file; see <a href="#file">file
    description</a>. Do not save line numbers in the output file and make sure
    the file ends with a blank line. If the specified file cannot be written
    to, print, "<tt>Cannot write to the specified file.</tt>" If the robot log
    is currently empty, print, "<tt>Cannot write to file, robot log is
    empty.</tt>" Once the file is saved, print "<tt>Successfully saved</tt>".
  </td>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>t <i>line#1</i> <i>line#2</i></tt></td>
  <td>
    <b>T</b>akes a copy of the line <i>line#1</i> and inserts it at
    <i>line#2</i>, shifting all commands after and including <i>line#2</i>
    down the list. For example, given the list:
    <dir>
      1 ABCD<br>
      2 EFGH<br>
      3 IJKL<br>
      4 MNOP<br>
    </dir>
    the command "t 2 4" would produce:
    <dir>
      1 ABCD<br>
      2 EFGH<br>
      3 IJKL<br>
      4 EFGH<br>
      5 MNOP<br>
    </dir>
    If an InvalidListPositionException is thrown, catch it and print,
    "<tt>Invalid line number.</tt>" If either argument is not an integer,
    print, "<tt>Please enter two valid integers.</tt>" Once the line is 
    copied, print "<tt>Successfully copied</tt>".
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>u <i>line#</i></tt></td>
  <td>
    <b>U</b>pdates the log by coping the line at <i>line#</i> to the end of the
    log. This does not remove the line at <i>line#</i>. If an
    InvalidListPositionException is thrown, catch it and print, "<tt>Invalid
    line number.</tt>" If the argument is not an integer, print, "<tt>Please
    enter a valid integer.</tt>" Once the line is copied, print 
    "<tt>Successfully copied</tt>".
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><tt>x</tt></td>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>After you have read this program page and given thought to the problem
we suggest the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are working with a partner, review the
      <a href="?r=coursework#pp">rules for pair programming</a>.</li>
  <li>Review these <a href="?r=styleGuide">style</a> and
      <a href="?r=commentingGuide">commenting</a> standards that are used to
      evaluate your program.</li>
  <li>You may use the Java development environment of your choice in CS 367.
      <em><b>However, all programs must compile and run on the lab computers
      for grading.</b></em> If you are going to use the CS
      <a href="?r=computerLabs">lab computers</a>, we recommend that you use
      Eclipse. You may want to review the
      <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/" target="_tab">Eclipse
      tutorial</a> to learn the basics. Note that on the Linux lab computers,
      you should enter "<tt>eclipse&amp;</tt>" at the prompt instead of what
      is described in the tutorial.</li>
  <li>Download the following to your programming assignment 2 directory:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="assignments/p2/files/ListNode.java"><tt>ListNode.java</tt></a></li>
        <li><a href="assignments/p2/files/LinkedListADT.java"><tt>LinkedListADT.java</tt></a></li>
        <li><a href="assignments/p2/files/RobotLogMain.java"><tt>RobotLogMain.java</tt></a></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Implement and thoroughly test your <tt>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</tt> class and any
      additional supporting classes, including your <tt>LinkedListIterator&lt;E&gt;</tt>
      and <tt>InvalidListPositionException</tt> classes.</li>
  <li>Incrementally implement the <tt>RobotLogMain</tt> class as specified in
      the <a href="#main">main program section</a> above. Test each step to
      ensure your program is working correctly before implementing the next
      step. Create a small text file for testing (it will be easier to debug
      than larger ones) and make sure you test all the boundary and negative
      cases as well as the positive cases.  
      <!--<em>Sample input file with corresponding output to be added soon.</em>-->
      <a name="InputFiles"></a> <em>Try this sample input file,
      <a href="assignments/p2/files/sampleLog.txt">sampleLog.txt</a>, 
      and make sure your program produces the <b>exact same</b> output, 
      <a href="assignments/p2/files/sampleOutput.txt">sampleOutput.txt</a>
      (i.e., when the user enters the same commands shown in the sample
      output).</em> Once you've got your program working on the small
      text file, create larger text files and make sure your program works 
      on those as well. Remember that the exact format of the file is unimportant,
      as long as it has one command per line, with a blank line at the end of the
      file. You can test your program using any text file that fits this description.
      </li>
  <li>If you are not using the lab computers to develop your program, make
      sure you compile and run your program to ensure that it works on the
      Linux lab computers. You can compile your Java source using <tt>javac</tt>
      in a terminal window as in this example: <dir><tt>javac *.java</tt></dir>
      and the run your program using <tt>java</tt> as in:

      <dir><tt>java RobotLogMain</tt></dir></li>
