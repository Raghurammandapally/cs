<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>The goals of this assignment are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and implement a circular doubly-linked list.</li>
  <li>Gain experience working with Java references (i.e., pointers).</li>
  <li>Implement an iterator.</li>
  <li>Implement exceptions.</li>
  <li>Gain experience writing classes which implement Java interfaces.</li>
  <li>Develop an application that processes input commands.</li>
  <li>Get more practice with command-line arguments and file I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>
  <p>You probably have seen an LED display that loops through a sequence of letters (such as is
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_display">depicted here</a>). For this assignment you will implement a simple console-based display editor that allows a user to create, edit, save, and load sequences of characters, which can be displayed in a dot matrix form on the output console.</p>
  <p>It is typical for today's programmers to use ADTs that are already
    implemented as part of a class library (e.g., C++ Standard Template Library)
    or an API (e.g., Java's Application Program Interface).  Understanding ADT <i>implementations</i> is still important to be able to make informed
    choices as to which ADT implementation is best suited for an application
    in terms of memory and time efficiencies. For example, knowing the tradeoffs
    between array and linked implementations of the <tt>List</tt> ADT helps us
    choose between Java's <tt>ArrayList</tt> and <tt>LinkedList</tt> classes. It is also important to be able to implement your own data structures
  when pre-built ones are not available or when standard ADTs (and their
  operations) are unsuitable for the intended application.</p>
  <p>In this assignment we provide you with an interface for a specialized ADT called a Loop. In addition to the main display editor application class, you will write a class which implements a Loop ADT using a circular doubly-linked list, as well as  iterator and exception classes needed to support your Loop ADT implementation.</p>

<a name="DisplayEditor"></a>
  <h3>Display Editor Menu of Commands</h3>
  <p>Your main method, in the file <tt>DisplayEditor.java</tt>, will create an empty <a href="#LoopADT">Loop</a> of characters and then prompt the user to enter commands, which it will process until the user
  types <b><tt>q</tt></b> for quit.  Your program will prompt for input by displaying :  
<dir><pre>enter command (? for help)&gt;</pre></dir>
  <p>If an invalid command is entered your program should display "<tt>invalid 
  command</tt>" and display the prompt again. You may assume that all commands will start with a single non-whitespace character.&nbsp; 
  Your program will need to ensure the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For the <tt>s</tt> and <tt>l</tt> commands, the first character should 
    be followed by a space and the remainder of the line should be a string 
    (representing a file name) starting with at least one non-whitespace 
    character. You may assume that the file name contains no spaces.</li>
    <li>For the <tt>a</tt> and <tt>i</tt> commands,
	  the first character should be followed by a space and 
	  the remainder of the line should be a string, which may include
          space characters.</li>
    <li>For the <tt>r</tt> command, the first character should be followed by a space and the remainder of the line should be a character.</li>
    <li>For the <tt>j</tt> command, the first character should be followed by a space and the 
  remainder of the line should be an integer. </li>
</ul>

  <p>If a valid command is entered, your program should carry out the command.</p>
  <p>If an enter is pressed, without typing any command, your program should simply display the prompt again.</p>
<p>Here are the display editor commands your program should provide:</p>

Each character should be saved one below the other and each character must be separated using a string of pound sign(#). For an example, see <a href="assignments/p2/files/sample.txt">sample.txt</a>.

</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Displaying the current context means displaying in the following order the character immediately before the current character, the current character, and the character immediately after the current character. For example, if the current character is 'B', the character before current is 'A', and the character after current is 'C', your program should display:  
<dir>
<pre>
  XXX
 X   X
 X   X
 XXXXX
 X   X
 X   X
 X   X
**********
 XXXX
 X   X

 XXXX
 X   X
 X   X
 XXXX
**********
  XXX
 X   x
 X
 X
 X
 X   x
  XXX

</pre>
  </dir>
  <p>The current character is displayed in between the 2 asterisk lines. However, if there are fewer
  than three characters in the loop, do the following: 
  <ul>
  <li>If the loop contains
  only one character, such as 'B', then display:
<dir>
<pre>

**********
 XXXX
 X   X
 X   X
 XXXX
 X   X
 X   X
 XXXX
**********

</pre>
</dir></li>
  <li>If the loop contains only two characters, such as 'B' and 'C', then display showing the current character first:
<dir><pre>

<a name="LoopADT"></a>
<h3>The Loop ADT</h3>

<p>A Loop is essentially a circular List, however, unlike a List, a Loop does not have a beginning or an end
and items within the Loop cannot be accessed using a position.  Instead, the Loop has a current item
and the ability to move forward or backwards.  A Loop can be modified by removing the current item or 
by adding an item either before or after the current item.  The Loop ADT is represented in Java by the 
<tt>LoopADT</tt> interface which is provided for you (see <a href="assignments/p2/files/LoopADT.java"><tt>LoopADT.java</tt></a>).
The documentation for the LoopADT interface can be found here (<a href="assignments/p2/files/LoopADT.html"><tt>LoopADT Documentation</tt></a> ).</p> 

<a name="MessageLoop"></a>
  <h3>The <tt>MessageLoop</tt> Class</h3>

  <p>You will write a <b>generic</b> <tt>MessageLoop</tt> class (in a file named <tt>MessageLoop.java</tt>)
  which implements the <a href="#LoopADT"><tt>LoopADT</tt> interface</a>. In addition to the methods given in the <tt>LoopADT</tt> interface, your <tt>MessageLoop</tt> class must have a constructor that takes no arguments and creates an empty message loop. You may not add any other public constructors or methods. You may include other private fields that you find helpful, but no public fields.</p>

  <p>The internal data structure used by the <tt>MessageLoop</tt> to contain the message must be  a <b>circular</b>, <b>doubly-linked</b> list of nodes.  <font color="red"> <em>You may <b>not</b> use Java's <tt>LinkedList</tt> class for this assignment.</em> </font> You must implement your own chain of doubly-linked nodes.

<p>To implement the circular, doubly-linked list, you will need to define a <b>generic</b> <tt>DblListnode</tt> class (in a file named <tt>DblListnode.java</tt>).  Your <tt>MessageLoop</tt> class will have a field of type <tt>DblListnode</tt>.
<p>Your application will use a message loop to store the message made up of characters in their dot matrix representation, which will be stored as a <tt>List of String</tt>s. Use Java's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> class for storing the <tt>List of String</tt>s.  

  <a name="Additional"></a>
  <h3>Additional Classes</h3>

  <p>There are three other classes that you will need to write to go along with your <tt>MessageLoop</tt> class. You are to use exception handling to signal to the application when the following problems occur. You will also use an iterator class to access the message loop.</p>

  <h4>The <tt>EmptyLoopException</tt> class</h4>
  <p>The <tt>EmptyLoopException</tt> must be an unchecked exception. It is thrown by some methods (as described in <a href="assignments/p2/files/LoopADT.html">the <tt>LoopADT</tt> interface documentation</a>).</p>

  <h4>The <tt>UnrecognizedCharacterException</tt> class</h4>
  <p>The <tt>UnrecognizedCharacterException</tt> must be an unchecked exception. It is thrown if the input for the commands (<b>a</b>dd, <b>i</b>nsert and <b>r</b>eplace) contains a character, which isn't specified in the <a href="assignments/p2/files/alphabets.txt">alphabets.txt</a> file, which is used for converting the characters to it's corresponding dot matrix representation. Your <a href="#DisplayEditor">DisplayEditor</a> class must be able to handle this exception and help the program to continue with it's normal execution. </p>  

  <h4>The <tt>MessageLoopIterator</tt> class</h4>
  <p>The <tt>LoopADT</tt> interface includes an <tt>iterator()</tt> method that returns an <tt>Iterator</tt> object. You must write a specialized iterator class, named <tt>MessageLoopIterator</tt>, which  
will be used as the type of iterator returned by the <tt>MessageLoop</tt>'s  <tt>iterator()</tt> method. The <tt>MessageLoopIterator</tt> class must implement the 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html"><tt>Iterator</tt></a> interface
(you do not need to implement the <tt>remove</tt> method - just throw an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>). 
You will need to write a constructor for your <tt>MessageLoopIterator</tt>; 
a package-access constructor that takes a <tt>DblListnode</tt> as a parameter is suggested. </p>

<h3>Dot Matrix Representation of Characters</h3>

<h4>Structure of a DblListnode as used by the Application</h4>
	<p>The message loop application will use the generic double linked listnodes to store the dot matrix representation of a character, using a list of strings. A <a href="assignments/p2/files/DoublyLinkedListNode.pdf">pictorial representation of a single node in the doubly linked list</a> is shown here.</p>

<h4>DotMatrix.java</h4>
<p>The class for converting a character to it's corresponding dot matrix representation is provided here (<a href="assignments/p2/files/DotMatrix.java">DotMatrix.java</a>). This class reads in the the <a href="assignments/p2/files/alphabets.txt">alphabets.txt</a> file which has the valid characters in the first line and the dot-matrix representation of the characters below that. The order of the characters in the first line of the file must match exactly with the order in which the characters are written below in it's dot matrix representation. eg. The character A is the third character in the first line and A's dot-matrix representation is the third one. Each dot-matrix representation must be separated by a string of <b>pound sign(#)</b> as shown in the file. There shouldn't be any empty lines in the alphabets.txt file. The dot-matrix representation of the space character is hard-coded in the DotMatrix.java file.</p>

<p>The method <b>loadAlphabets()</b> loads the mapping between a character and it's dot-matrix representation in a TreeMap. Once loaded, you can use the getDotMatrix() function to get the corresponding dot matrix representation of a particular character.</p>

<p>The method <b>getDotMatrix()</b> takes in a string of length one (i.e. a character represented as a String) as it's argument( eg."A" or "a") and returns the character's dot matrix representation as a List of Strings. This dot matrix representation can be used as the data part of the node in the doubly linked list.</p>

<p>The method <b>isValidCharacter()</b> takes in a string of length one (i.e. a character represented as a String) as it's argument and returns true if that character is defined in the alphabets.txt file, else returns false.</p>

<p>You are to use the <a href="assignments/p2/files/DotMatrix.java">DotMatrix</a> class in your <a href="#DisplayEditor">DisplayEditor</a> to load the mapping of character to dot-matrix representation using the alphabets.txt file, to retrieve a character's dot matrix representation and to check if a character is a valid character.</p>

  <p><font color="red">Do not modify the DotMatrix.java file.</font></p>
</div>
<div>
  <a name="Testing"></a> 
  <h3>Testing</h3> 
  <p>Testing interactive programs can be frustrating if you aren't careful about 
    recording the commands that you've entered. A bug can suddenly occur and you 
    may not recall the exact sequence of commands to reproduce the bug. A 
    technique for testing interactive programs is to process a fixed set of 
    commands from an input file. Input files can be developed to test particular 
    aspects of the program and these tests are easily repeated by running the 
    program again on a particular input file.</p> 
  <p>Your program may be provided with <b>two, optional, command-line arguments</b>: the first command line argument specifies the name of an input file containing browser commands and the second argument specifies the name of the file which stores the dot matrix representation of the characters. </p>

  <h5>First Command Line Argument</h5>
  If the file specified as the first command line argument doesn't exist or is unable to be opened,
  display "<tt>problem with input file</tt>" and quit.
  <p>Otherwise, you may assume the file contains lines that are either one of the following:
  <ul>
  <li>a single character</li>
  <li>a single character followed by one space and then another character</li> 
  <li>a single character followed by one space and then an integer </li>
  <li>a single character followed by one space and then a string of characters(including the space character)</li>
  </ul>
  </p> 
  <p>
  You may also assume that the last line always has a single "<tt>q</tt>" for quit.
  <h5>Second Command Line Argument</h5> 
   <p>The second command line argument will allow you to play around with new font styles or characters that aren't yet in the <a href="assignments/p2/files/alphabets.txt">alphabets.txt</a> file.
   For your assignment purposes, we have provided you with a sample file <b>alphabets.txt</b> that contains the dot matrix representation of all English alphabets.</p>
  <p>If <b>one or more than two</b> command-line 
  arguments are given, display "<tt>invalid command-line arguments</tt>" and quit.</p> 
 
  <p>If no command-line argument is provided, your program should first prompt "<tt>Enter the dot-matrix alphabets file:</tt>".
You need to enter the name of the dot matrix representation file (you could use the <a href="assignments/p2/files/alphabets.txt">alphabets.txt</a> file that we have provided and add additional characters to it). But remember that it should follow the same file format.
  Then the program operates as an interactive console application reading commands from the console keyboard and displaying
  the results in the console window. 
  </p> 
 
  <p>Input from either the console or a file can be accomplished easily. If no 
  command-line arguments are provided, construct  a 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html"><tt>Scanner</tt></tt></a> from <tt>System.in</tt> as shown (see also  
  <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~hasti/cs367-common/resources/JavaIO/JavaIO_Scanner.html">Java I/O</a>):   
  <dir><pre>// assuming 'in' has been declared as a Scanner  
in = new Scanner(System.in); 
</pre></dir> 
  Now you can read from the console keyboard using <tt>in</tt>.</p> 
 
  <p>If you are using two command-line arguments, do the following:<dir><pre>
                boolean useFile = args.length == 2;
                if (useFile) {
                        File inFile = new File(args[0]);
                        if (!inFile.exists() || !inFile.canRead()) {
                            System.err.println("Problem with input file!");
                            System.exit(1);
                         }
                        try {
                         in = new Scanner(inFile);
                        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
                            System.err.println("Problem with input file!");
                            System.exit(1);
                        }
                }
                else
                        in = new Scanner(System.in);
</pre></dir> 
 Now <tt>in</tt> can be used to read from the input file. 
You can use a similar construct to handle the second command line argument (i.e. the file specifying the dot matrix representations).</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>After you have read this program page and given thought to the problem
    we suggest the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Review the collaboration policy
      concerning <a href="?r=coursework#pp">pair programming</a></li>

      <li>Review these
      <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs302/resources/guides/style.html">style</a> and
      <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs302/resources/guides/commenting.html">commenting</a>
      standards that are used to evaluate your program's style.</li>

	  <li>You may use the Java development environment of your choice in CS 367.
      <em><b>However, all programs must compile and run on the lab computers
      for grading.</b></em> If you are going to use the CS
      <a href="?r=computerLabs">lab computers</a>, we recommend that you use
      Eclipse. You may want to review the
      <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/" target="_tab">Eclipse
      tutorial</a> to learn the basics. Note that on the Linux lab computers,
      you should enter "<tt>eclipse&amp;</tt>" at the prompt instead of what
      is described in the tutorial.</li>

      <li>Write the <tt>EmptyLoopException</tt> class.</li>
	  <li>Write the <tt>UnrecognizedCharacterException</tt> class.</li>
      <li>Incrementally implement and test the methods of <tt>MessageLoop</tt> class (leaving the <tt>iterator()</tt> method until the end).  You
          might want to use a driver program for your tests.</li>
     <li>Implement and test the <tt>MessageLoopIterator</tt> class and the <tt>iterator()</tt> method of the
<tt>MessageLoop</tt> class.</li>      <li>Implement the <tt>DisplayEditor</tt> class, <a href="#DisplayEditor">as described above</a>, using a <tt>LoopADT</tt>
          object.</li>
          <a name="TestFiles"></a>
      <li>Test your program by developing test files as described in the
          <a href="#Testing">testing section</a> above.

          <em>Try this sample input file,
          <a href="assignments/p2/files/test.txt">test.txt</a> and make sure your program produces the  <b>exact same</b> output,
          <a href="assignments/p2/files/testOutput.txt">testOutput.txt</a>.</em>          You can check if your program is producing the exact same output using the <tt>diff</tt> Unix command. First download both the sample input file and the corresponding output file into the same folder as your program.  Then enter the
 following commands:
<dir>
<pre>javac *.java
java DisplayEditor test.txt alphabets.txt &gt; myOutput.txt
diff myOutput.txt testOutput.txt
</pre>
</dir>The "<tt>&gt; myOutput.txt</tt>" part of the second command redirects the console output to a file named <tt>myOutput.txt
</tt>
(if <tt>myOutput.txt</tt> already exists, you'll need to delete it before executing the second command).The <tt>diff</tt> command compares the two files character by character and display any lines that differ (enter the command "<tt>man diff</tt>" for more information).  If anything gets displayed as a result of executing the
<tt>diff</tt> command, then your program is not producing the correct output.
          <br>
          </li>

      <li>If you are not using the lab computers to develop your program, make sure you compile
          and run your program to ensure that it works on the Linux lab computers. You can compile
          your Java source files using <tt>javac</tt> in a terminal window as in this example:
<pre>    javac *.java
</pre>
    and then run your program using <tt>java</tt> as in:

<pre>    java DisplayEditor test.txt alphabets.txt
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Submit your work for grading.</li>
