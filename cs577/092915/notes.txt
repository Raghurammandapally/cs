correctness patterns for greedy:
  "greedy stays ahead"
    setup some measure for quality of partial solution
    at every point, greedy does as well as any other possible soln
  "exchange argument"
    make small local changes at every stop, none of them making the soln worse
    show that, after a finite number of steps, we arrive at the greedy soln

digraph
path
strong connectivity (in a directed graph): v ~ w iff v -> w and w -> v
strongly connected components
  a node in and of itself is a strongly connected component
