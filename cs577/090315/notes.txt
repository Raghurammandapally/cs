stable marriage problem
-------------
n boys, n girls
ranked preference list for each person (assume no ties)
req: 
  no rogue couples (no b/g that prefer each other to the people they are paired with)
  stable iff no rogue couples
input: set of pref lists
output: stable pairing

does stable pairing always exist?

idea: start with some pairing, and whenever their is a rogue couple, let them break up
  if this halts, we know trivially that this is stable
  question: can we argue that there is a stable state?
  answer: no, their can be cycles if we don't specify which rogue couple breaks up (consider n=3 counterex)

soln (see notes)

claim: traditional marriage alg (TMA) always produces a stable pairing
  does it always terminate?
    situation where the alg doesn't specify what to do next?
    infinite loop?
    definitely produces a pairing if there is no core dump
  unless a boy crosses off all the girls on his list
theorem: alg should terminate in at most n^2 days
  "master list" argument
  since each list never drops below 1, there will be max n(n-1) <= n^2

theorem: tma produces male-optimal pairing
  B ------S------A

  D ------S------C

  D: X,Y,A,...,O,...,C


notes afterwards:
------------------
claim on slides 9/10:
  Idea: Allow the pairs to keep breaking up and reforming until they become stable.  
  Can you argue that the couples will not  continue breaking up and reforming forever?

    As we mentioned, Knuth showed that just choosing an arbitrary rogue couple to resolve at each step can cause the process to cycle without reaching a stable matching.
    "In fact, Knuth showed in 1990 that just doing evolutionary approach by choosing an arbitrary rogue couple may result in the process cycling indefinitely without reaching a stable matching. (See the comments at the end of the notes.)"
