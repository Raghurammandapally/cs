  depth of recursion tree is b-1. length is computed on #edges, not #vertices

p. 13
  use mu(a,b) = a + b as potential fxn for termination proof of iterative gcd alg




review:
-----------------
[ ] homework: show there cannot be an inf chain of recursive calls that get simpler, rather than explicit potential fxn
[ ] correctness of recursive power fxn in one shot (p. 10)
