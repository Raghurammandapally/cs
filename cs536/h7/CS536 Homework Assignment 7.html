<title>CS536 Homework Assignment 7</title>

<style type="text/css"></style></head><body>

<h1>H7</h1><b>Due by 11:00 pm on Tuesday Nov 17</b><h2 id="Questions">Questions</h2><p class="sectionDesc">Homework assignments must be done individually. Collaboration on homework assignments is
<em>not</em> allowed.</p><p class="reg">The C language allows you to define new names for existing types using <em>typedefs</em>.
Here is some example code that uses typedefs:
</p><dir><pre>typedef int money;
int x;
money y;
typedef money dollars;
dollars z;

x = 10;
y = x;    // OK because x and y are of type int
z = y;    // OK because y and z are of type int
</pre></dir><p class="reg">
The first typedef defines <tt>money</tt> to be a synonym for <tt>int</tt>. Any declaration that
follows this typedef can use <tt>money</tt> instead of <tt>int</tt>. The second typedef defines
<tt>dollars</tt> to be a synonym for <tt>money</tt>, which makes it a synonym for <tt>int</tt>.
Any declaration that follows this typedef can use <tt>dollars</tt> instead of <tt>int</tt>.
</p><p class="reg">Typedefs can also be used with <tt>struct</tt> types:</p><dir><pre>struct Pair {
    int x;
    int y;
};
typedef struct Pair Point;
Point p;
</pre></dir><p class="reg">
A typedef can occur anywhere that a variable declaration (local or global) can occur.
The usual C scoping rules apply to the names in typedefs. Note that <tt>typedef int money;</tt>
is considered to be a <i>declaration</i> of the name <tt>money</tt> and that both <tt>money x;</tt>
and <tt>typedef money dollars;</tt> are considered to be <i>uses</i> of the name <tt>money</tt>.
</p><h3 id="Question 1">Question 1:</h3><p class="reg">
Assume that the following productions have been added to the grammar for the YES language:
</p><dir><pre>decl &#8594; typedef
typedef &#8594; TYPEDEF type ID SEMICOLON
</pre></dir><p class="reg">
What other productions need to be changed and/or added to the YES grammar
to allow typedefs?
</p><h3 id="Question 2">Question 2:</h3><p class="reg">
Now consider the name-analysis phase of the compiler.
Note that, in addition to the usual errors for multiply-defined
names and for uses of undefined names, the name analyzer must
enforce the following rules:
</p><ul class="reg">
  <li>
    <p>The declaration <tt>typedef T xxx;</tt> is an error if <tt>T</tt> is
       not a built-in type (e.g., <tt>int, bool</tt>)
       or a <tt>struct</tt> type (in which case <tt>T</tt> will be of the form: <tt>struct ttt</tt>) or a new type defined by a previous typedef in the current
       or an enclosing scope.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>The declaration <tt>typedef T xxx;</tt> is an error if <tt>xxx</tt>
       has already been declared in the current scope (as a variable,
       function, parameter, or new type).
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>A variable, function, or parameter can only be declared to be of
       type <tt>T</tt> if <tt>T</tt> is either a built-in type or a
       new type defined by a previous typedef in the current
       or an enclosing scope.
  (A variable can still be declared to be of type <tt>struct ttt</tt> as before.)</p></li>
</ul><p class="reg">
Answer each of the following questions:
</p><ol type="a" class="reg">
  <li><p>What information should be stored with each name in the symbol table?
  </p></li>
  <li><p>What should be done to process a typedef: <tt>typedef T xxx;</tt>?
  </p></li>
  <li><p>What should be done to process a declaration of a
       variable, function, or parameter named <tt>xxx</tt> and
       declared to be of type <tt>T</tt>?
  </p></li>
  <li><p>What should be done to process the use of a name <tt>xxx</tt> in a statement?
  </p></li>
</ol><p class="reg">
Illustrate your answer by showing the entries that would be in the
symbol table after processing the following declarations:
</p><dir><pre>struct MonthDayYear {
    int month;
    int day;
    int year;
};
typedef struct MonthDayYear date;
date today;
typedef int dollars;
dollars salary;
typedef dollars moreDollars;
moreDollars md;
int d;
