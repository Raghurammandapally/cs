<p class="sectionDesc">Homework assignments must be done individually. Collaboration on homework assignments is
<em>not</em> allowed.</p>

<p class="reg">
Recall that for <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/courses/cs536-f15/asn/h3/h3.html">homework assignment 3</a> we defined the language of
<i>regular expressions</i> as follows:
</p>

<p class="reg">The operands in our language regular expressions are single  letters or &#949; (epsilon). The operators  are:
</p>
<ul class="reg">
  <li>| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means "or" (alternation)</li>
  <li>writing two or more things next to each other means "followed by" (catenation)</li>
  <li>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means "zero or more" (closure or iteration)</li>
  <li>+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means "one or more" (positive closure)</li>
  <li>( ) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are used for grouping</li>
</ul>
<p class="reg">
  In a regular expression, * and + have the same, highest precedence,
  "followed by" has middle precedence, and | has the lowest precedence. All of the operators are left associative.
</p>

<p class="reg">
Below are 6 incorrect CFGs for the language of regular expressions.
For each CFG, do <b><em>one</em></b> of the following:
</p>

<ol type="a" class="reg">
  <li>Give one string that is a legal regular expression (given our definition above), but is not in
       the language of the CFG.</li>
  <li>Give one string that is not a legal regular expression (given our definition above), but is in
       the language of the CFG.</li>
  <li>Show that the CFG is ambiguous by drawing two different parse
       trees for some string in the language of the CFG.</li>
</ol>
<p class="reg">For cases (a) and (b),
  be sure to say which of the two cases you are illustrating. </p>
<p class="reg">Note that the terminals are 
<tt>LTR</tt>, <tt>EPS</tt>, <tt>OR</tt>, <tt>STAR</tt>, <tt>PLUS</tt>, <tt>LPAR</tt>, and <tt>RPAR</tt>. 
Note also that there is a difference between the terminal <tt>EPS</tt> (which represents the token epsilon in our language of regular expressions) and the symbol &#949; (which is used on the right-hand-side of a grammar production indicating the non-terminal on the left-hand-side derives an empty sequence of symbols).</p>
