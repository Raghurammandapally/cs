For this homework you will define a syntax-directed translation
for the CFG given below, which defines a very simple programming language.

<h3 id="Question1">Question 1:</h3>
<p class="reg">
Write a syntax-directed translation for the CFG given above, so that the
translation of an input program is the <i>set</i> of variables used somewhere in the program. 
Note: here the term <i>use</i> is in contrast to <i>declaration</i>; 
any appearance of a variable  that is not a variable declaration counts as a <i>use</i> of that variable. For the example code in <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/courses/cs536-f15/asn/h4/h4.html#Question2">Question 2</a>, the translation should be <tt>{ x, a, b }</tt>.</p>
<p class="reg">Your translation rules should use the following notation:</p>
<ul class="reg">
  <li><tt>{ }</tt> is an empty set</li>
  <li><tt>{ ID.value }</tt> is a set containing the variable whose
       name is the value associated with this <tt>ID</tt> token</li>
  <li><tt>S1</tt> &#8745; <tt>S2</tt> is the intersection of sets <tt>S1</tt> and <tt>S2</tt></li>
  <li><tt>S1</tt> &#8746; <tt>S2</tt> is the union of sets <tt>S1</tt> and <tt>S2</tt></li>
  <li> <tt>S1 - S2</tt> is the set of all items that are in <tt>S1</tt> but not in <tt>S2</tt></li>
</ul>
<p class="reg">
Note that you should not try to use something like "<tt>{ a, b }</tt>"
to mean a set with two elements;
instead, use set union to combine
two sets that each contain one element.</p>
<p class="reg">
Use the notation that was used in class and in the on-line readings;
i.e., use <tt>nonterminal.trans</tt> to mean the translation
of a nonterminal, and <tt>terminal.value</tt> to mean the
value of a terminal.
Assume that <tt>ID.value</tt> is a <tt>String</tt> (the name of the
identifier).
Use subscripts for translation rules that include the same nonterminal
or the same terminal more than once.</p>


<h3 id="Question2">Question 2:</h3>
<p class="reg">
Draw a parse tree for the program given below and
annotate each nonterminal in the tree with its translation.
</p>
<dir>
<pre>main ( ) { 
    int x;
    bool y;
    x = a;
    int z;
    if (x == a) {
        int x;
        b = x &lt; 18;
    }
}
</pre>
