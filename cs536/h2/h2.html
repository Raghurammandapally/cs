Java (as well as C and C++) allows comments delimited by "<tt>/*</tt>" and "<tt>*/</tt>".
This kind of comment can be defined in English as follows:
</p>
<dir class="reg">
A comment consists of three parts:
<ol>
  <li>a slash followed by a star, followed by</li>
  <li>the body of the comment, followed by</li>
  <li>a star followed by a slash.</li>
</ol>
The body of the comment can be empty, or can contain any characters except
the two-character sequence "<tt>*/</tt>".
</dir>

<p class="reg">
Note that the body of a comment <b><em>can</em></b> include stars and
slashes, just not "<tt>*/</tt>".
</p>

<p class="reg">
Assume that the following JLex macros have been defined:
</p>
<dir><pre>SLASH     = [/]
STAR      = [*]
</pre></dir>

<h3 id="Question1">Question 1:</h3>
<p class="reg">
Below are 5 <b><em>incorrect</em></b> JLex patterns
for the kind of comment defined above.
For each pattern, explain what is wrong.
For example, you might say
<i>The pattern does not allow the comment body to include stars</i>,
or <i>The pattern does allow the comment body to include */</i>.
If the pattern both disallows some "good" comments and allows some
"bad" comments, give two explanations, one for each problem with
the pattern.
Then, for each problem with the pattern, give a string that illustrates
the problem;
i.e.,
give a string that is <b><em>not</em></b> matched by the pattern but is
a "good" comment and/or
give a string that <b><em>is</em></b> matched by the pattern but is a "bad"
comment.
<em><b>Be sure that it is clear whether your example strings are intended
to be "good" or "bad" comments.</b></em>
</p>
<dir><pre>{SLASH}{STAR}[^(*/)]*{STAR}{SLASH}

{SLASH}{STAR}(.)*{STAR}{SLASH}

{SLASH}{STAR}([^*]*{STAR}+[^*/])*{STAR}+{SLASH}

{SLASH}{STAR}([^*]|[^/])+{STAR}{SLASH}

{SLASH}{STAR}[^*]*{STAR}+{SLASH}+
</pre></dir>


<h3 id="Question2">Question 2:</h3>
<p class="reg">
Give a correct JLex pattern for comments as defined above.
You may define and use additional macros.
Make your pattern as readable as possible.
