<h1>CS536 Homework 6<br>
<b>Due by 11pm pm on Thursday, Nov 5</b> (not accepted late)
</h1>

<br>





<h3 id="Question 1">Question 1:</h3>
<p class="reg">Suppose that students' grades are kept in a file with the following format:</p>
<ul class="reg">
<li>The file contains one or more student records.</li>
<li>Each student record has one student's name, then their ID number, then zero or more grades, separated by commas.</li>
<li>Each grade is an integer value followed by zero or more stars (to represent the number of  days late).</li>
</ul>
<p class="reg">Here's a CFG for the grade file format:</p>

<dir><pre>file &#8594; record tail
tail &#8594; file | &#949;
record	&#8594; NAME IDNUM optGrades
optGrades &#8594; grades | &#949;
grades &#8594; oneGrade | oneGrade COMMA grades
oneGrade &#8594; INTLIT optLate
optLate &#8594; stars | &#949;
stars &#8594; STAR | stars STAR</pre></dir>

<ol class="reg" type="a">
<li><p>Although the grade file CFG given above is not LL(1), some correct inputs can be parsed by a predictive parser. This is because those inputs never cause the parser to look at a table entry that contains two or more CFG rules.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Give the shortest such input (as a sequence of tokens, ending
with <tt>EOF</tt>).</li>
<li>Draw the parse tree that the parser would build for the input you gave for Part (i).
(Do not include the <tt>EOF</tt> token in the parse tree.)</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>
What is the shortest sequence of tokens that would
"stump" a predictive parser trying to parse the language of this CFG
(i.e., a sequence of tokens that is a prefix of a valid input, but
for which the parser would not know how
to continue to build the parse tree top-down because it looks at
a table entry that contains two or more CFG rules)?
To answer this question, give all of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
  <li>The sequence of tokens (a <b>prefix</b> of a valid input).</li>
  <li> The (partial) parse tree that the predictive parser would have
       built before being stumped.</li>
  <li> The CFG rules that the predictive parser can't choose between
       to continue to grow the parse tree.</li>
</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="Question 2">Question 2:</h3>
<p class="reg">
This question concerns the following  grammar (where non-terminals are  in lower-case and terminals are in upper-case):
</p><dir><pre>aa &#8594; A ee bb B

bb &#8594; cc bb
   | &#949;

cc &#8594; D C
   | F ee bb B dd

dd &#8594; E A ee bb B
   | &#949;

ee &#8594; ff ee
   | &#949;

ff &#8594; hh D gg

gg &#8594; C
   | H C

hh &#8594; G
   | J
</pre></dir>
<p class="reg">
Provide a table with the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for all
of this grammar's nonterminals.
Provide a  second table with the FIRST sets for all of the production
right-hand sides.
